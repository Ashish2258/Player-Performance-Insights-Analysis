**Project Title: Player Performance Insights Analysis**

#### **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on analyzing football player performance data to derive meaningful insights into player attributes, skills, and club statistics. Using data-driven techniques, we explore key trends, correlations, and metrics that contribute to understanding player performance.

#### **Key Features**  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for accurate analysis.
- Outlier detection and handling using the IQR method.
- Visualization of player statistics, including heatmaps and boxplots, to reveal patterns and correlations.
- Performance analysis across multiple attributes like attacking, defending, and goalkeeping.
- Insights into top-performing players and their key metrics.

#### **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for data visualization
